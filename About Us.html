        <h3>Angelica, 23, Italian</h3>
        <p> Moved to London from Parma, right in the heart of the Italian Food Valley. While pretending to enjoy Sunday roasts and pale ales, she likes to spend the weekend exploring the city, in between brunches and rooftop bars. She prefers to live in a big city and escape in quiet and remote places when a break is needed!

        <p> Born in Singapore, Melanie enjoys a variety of food. Japanese and Vietnamese cuisine are her top choices and sheâ€™ll always be found wandering Chinatown on the weekends looking for her next favourite dish.
		If not for her love of food, she would choose to live near the ocean. </p>
